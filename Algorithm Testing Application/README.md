# Algorithm Testing Application
- **Developer:** Carmen Mosquera
- **Category:** Algorithms and Data Structures
- **Course:** CS 499 Computer Science Capstone
- **Artifact:** From a C++ text-base file handler to a Dynamic algorithm testing application using JavaFX.

  <br>

## Project Overview
The algorithm testing application is an educational desktop application designed to help users visualize and compare the performance of common sorting and searching algorithms. Built with Java and JavaFX, this tool is ideal for students, educators, and curious coders looking to deepen their understanding of algorithm behavior through real-time visuals and metrics.

## Features
- **Real-Time Visualizations**: See how algorithms operate step-by-step with animated visual feedback.
- **Algorithms Included:** 
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Binary Search
  - Lineal Search
  - Map Search
- **Performance Comparison:** Monitor runtime and memory usage across varying datasets to evaluate efficiency.
- **Dataset Variety:** Test algorithms on randomized or custom input arrays of different sizes.
- **Interactive Controls:** Modify input size, control execution speed, and reset views with a user-friendly interface.


## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- JavaFX SDK (if your IDE requires it separately)

## Testing the Application
- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/CaMosq/Computer-Science-Capstone-Projects.git
- Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Make sure JavaFX libraries are configured properly for your build environment
- You'll find two main folders:
  - Enhanced Dynamic JavaFX version: this is the folder you're going to use.
    
  - Initial C++ text-based version: This was the initial project for one my previous courses that gave me the idea and the foundation to create this dynamic application. I attached this project here for reference, to show how something small and basic can become amazing and extraodinary with discipline and persistency.
- Open "Enhanced Dynamic JavaFX version" folder    
- Run the main class: MainApplication.java
- The GUI will launch, and you can start exploring and comparing algorithms.


## Technologies Used
- Java
- JavaFX
- Object-Oriented Programming principles

## Project Motivation
This project was developed as a capstone during my Computer Science degree to illustrate the practical implementation and performance characteristics of core algorithms. My goal was to make theoretical content more intuitive and engaging through interactive design.

## Future Improvements
- Add more algorithms
- Save and load custom datasets
- Export performance reports

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! If you‚Äôd like to suggest improvements or expand the algorithm list, feel free to fork the repository and share your ideas.
